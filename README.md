# 🚀 PingUp Chat App

## 📌 Problem Understanding

Today, millions of users rely on messaging platforms like WhatsApp for daily communication and media sharing. However, most of these applications are foreign-based, and users often do not fully understand how their data is handled in the backend.

Although some Indian messaging applications exist, many of them are either not fully featured or do not provide the same smooth experience as global platforms. Because of this, users hesitate to switch to Indian alternatives.

After observing these challenges, we decided to develop **PingUp Chat App** — a secure, fully featured, and user-friendly messaging platform.

## 🔐 Security Commitment

User privacy is our top priority.  
PingUp provides **End-to-End Encryption**, ensuring that:

- Messages are encrypted before sending

We are committed to building a platform that users can trust.
